To integrate OneDrive in your Android app, you'll follow a roadmap similar to the one you used for your PyQt6 application, but adapted for the Android ecosystem. Here's a conceptual roadmap based on your existing structure:

### 1. **Understand the Current Structure**

- **`MainActivity.kt`**: Entry point of the app.
- **`data/local`**: Handles local data storage and retrieval.
    - **`com.app.routineturboa.data.local.DatabaseHelper.kt`**: Manages SQLite database operations.
    - **`RoutineRepository.kt`**: Likely manages data operations and serves as an intermediary between the ViewModel and the database.
- **`data/model`**: Defines the data models used in the app.
    - **`Task.kt`**: Represents a task object.
- **`ui`**: Manages the user interface components.
    - **`MainScreen.kt`**: Defines the main screen layout.
    - **`components`**: Contains reusable UI components like `Greeting.kt` and `TaskItem.kt`.
- **`viewmodel`**: Manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
    - **`TaskViewModel.kt`**: Contains logic to manage tasks.
    - **`TaskViewModelFactory.kt`**: Factory to create instances of `TaskViewModel`.
- **`util`**: Contains utility functions.
    - **`TimeUtils.kt`**: Utility functions related to time.
    - **`copyDatabase.kt`**: Utility functions to copy database files.

### 2. **Integrate Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Android**

- **Set up MSAL Configuration:**
    - Add the MSAL configuration JSON file (`msal_config.json`) in the `res/raw` directory.
    - Configure MSAL in `AndroidManifest.xml`.

- **Authenticate Users:**
    - Use MSAL to handle user authentication.
    - Store the access token securely using Android's shared preferences or a secure storage mechanism.

### 3. **Set Up OneDrive Integration**

- **Create OneDrive Helper Class:**
    - A new helper class to manage OneDrive operations (similar to `OneDriveUploader`).
    - Use Microsoft Graph SDK to interact with OneDrive.

### 4. **Modify `com.app.routineturboa.data.local.DatabaseHelper.kt` to Sync with OneDrive**

- **Upload Database:**
    - Implement a method to upload the SQLite database file to OneDrive.
- **Download Database:**
    - Implement a method to download the SQLite database file from OneDrive and replace the local database.

### 5. **Add UI Components for OneDrive Integration**

- **Modify `MainActivity.kt` and `MainScreen.kt`:**
    - Add UI elements (e.g., buttons) to trigger database upload and download.
    - Ensure these UI components are linked to the appropriate methods in the ViewModel.

### 6. **Modify `TaskViewModel.kt` for Sync Operations**

- **Add Sync Methods:**
    - Add methods to the ViewModel to handle the OneDrive sync operations, calling the corresponding methods in the OneDrive helper class.

### 7. **Handle Permissions and Network Connectivity**

- **Permissions:**
    - Ensure the app has the necessary permissions to access the internet and manage files.
- **Network Connectivity:**
    - Handle network connectivity issues gracefully, providing feedback to the user when necessary.

### Detailed Conceptual Steps

1. **MSAL Setup:**
    - Add `msal_config.json` to `res/raw`.
    - Configure the MSAL library in `AndroidManifest.xml` with the correct permissions and redirect URI.

2. **Authentication Flow:**
    - Initialize MSAL in `MainActivity.kt`.
    - Add methods for logging in and acquiring tokens.
    - Store the acquired token securely.

3. **OneDrive Helper Class:**
    - Create a new class `OneDriveHelper` in `com.app.routineturbo_android.util`.
    - Use the Microsoft Graph SDK to interact with OneDrive.
    - Methods:
        - `login()` for authentication.
        - `uploadFile()` to upload the database.
        - `downloadFile()` to download the database.

4. **Sync Methods in `com.app.routineturboa.data.local.DatabaseHelper.kt`:**
    - Add methods for exporting and importing the database.
    - Use `OneDriveHelper` to upload and download the database file.

5. **UI Modifications:**
    - Add buttons in `MainScreen.kt` for "Upload to OneDrive" and "Download from OneDrive".
    - Link these buttons to new ViewModel methods for syncing the database.

6. **ViewModel Changes:**
    - In `TaskViewModel.kt`, add methods `uploadDatabaseToOneDrive()` and `downloadDatabaseFromOneDrive()`.
    - These methods should call the respective methods in `OneDriveHelper`.

7. **Permissions and Network Handling:**
    - Ensure the app has internet and file access permissions.
    - Handle cases where the network is unavailable or the user is not authenticated.

### Conclusion

By following this roadmap, you will be able to integrate OneDrive into your Android app, allowing users to upload and download their SQLite database. This ensures data is backed up and can be synchronized across devices. Remember to handle edge cases and provide clear feedback to the user throughout the process.
