My App is called RoutineTurboA ('A' stands for Android) and simply RoutineTurbo (Windows version built on PyQt6).

The app operates on a strict 24-hour (1440-minute) daily timeline. On the first launch, it displays two blocks spanning the entire 24 hours (00:01 - 23:59) with default task names. Users can add new tasks, input start and end times, set reminders, add notes, specify task types (like Main, Quick, Helper, etc.), link Helper tasks to Main Tasks, adjust duration, and more. The app logic ensures there are no gaps in the schedule by automatically allocating unassigned minutes to adjacent task blocks. Editing times or duration, adding or deleting tasks, and other operations adjust the timeline to maintain the continuity. Task types include Main Tasks, Default Tasks (basic everyday activities), Quick Tasks (1-2 minute tasks), and Helper Tasks (supporting Main Tasks), with more types planned for the future.

The Android version targets API level 34 (Android 14.0) and has a minimum SDK of 30, ensuring compatibility with devices running Android 12 and above. It is developed in Kotlin, using Jetpack Compose for the UI, Room for database management, and the KSP plugin for code generation. OneDrive integration is managed using MSAL, and it's purpose is to sync the routine data between Windows and Android version.

Database Design Overview: Both versions use a SQLite database to manage tasks in way that maintains consistency across both platforms for proper data synchronization.

Table Structure:

| Column     | Data Type | Description                                  |
|------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| id         | INTEGER    | Primary key, auto-incremented.               |
| name       | TEXT       | Task name.                                   |
| notes      | TEXT       | Optional task notes (default is empty).      |
| duration   | INTEGER    | Task duration in minutes.                    |
| startTime  | TEXT       | Start time in ISO string format.             |
| endTime    | TEXT       | End time in ISO string format.               |
| reminder   | TEXT       | Reminder time in ISO string format.          |
| type       | TEXT       | Task type (e.g., Main, Quick, Helper, etc.). |
| position   | INTEGER    | Task position in the schedule.               |
| mainTaskId | INTEGER    | Reference to the main task ID (if applicable).|

DateTime Handling:

Windows Version: startTime, endTime, and reminder are stored as ISO 8601 strings. A 'T' is inserted between the date and time to align with Android formatting. These strings are converted to DateTime objects in the app model.
Android Version: startTime, endTime, and reminder are LocalDateTime objects in the TaskEntity class. A TypeConverters class handles conversion between LocalDateTime and ISO strings.

I am a beginner who has developed most of this app using AI tools, like GPT and Claude. I am seeking guidance on refining both the Android version (RoutineTurboA) and the Windows version (RoutineTurbo, built with PyQt6). My goal is to learn as I build. It's imperative that the advice must incorporate the latest APIs, methods, and best practices as of 2024. Please ensure that all suggestions are compatible with the versions I mentioned earlier and avoid any deprecated or outdated approaches.

Today, it's about RoutineTurboA, the android version.
